Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers.
- Since they're looking to modernize their operations, they developed a new custom software and wanted to also use the most current and effective software security.
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
- When analyzing the software, there were a few areas in the files were potential threats could have bee introduced, particularly when the program asks for user input..
- It's important to code securely to ensure the protection of both the company and its customers which could be made vulnerable should precautions not be taken.
- A cmopany that has safe practices will instill trust in its customers.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- Input Validation, I suppose it's because I needed to get more creative and figure out how to mitigate the risk.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- By using the vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, provided by the school. It includes, Input Valiation, APIs, Cryptography, Client/Server, Code Error, Code Quaality and Encapsulation sections.
- Each of these primarily focus around making sure that protions of code that fall within these categories are secure and do not allow for unintentional outsider influence.
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- Doing a quick test of the code and checking for errors was how I could tell the code at least ran and didn't come across major issues.
- Regarding possible vulnerabilities, the dependency check was able to bring to light additional risk factors.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- The OWASP Maven Dependency check could see a lot of use.
- Since the course was focused heavily on computer security, I feel that if I were to take on a career as a software developer, it would be a frequently used tool.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- I think the dependency check would be a suitable highlight. It feels like it was more of a focus and interesting topic, at least for myself.
